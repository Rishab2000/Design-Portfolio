          <p>Summary</p>
          <p>
            As a part of this internship, I designed core features & UI elements
            for our product, SD+. For this effort, I carefully balanced
            usability, business and technical goals. The overall user experience
            of the redesigned product was proved easy to use by multiple users
            in hands-on demos conducted after the interim release.

            <p>
              With the initial version of the product, we attempted to validate
              its usability through demos. Through this, we learned that they
              found the current usability & functionality insufficient for their
              needs.

            <p>We realized...</p>
            <p>
              that a well defined design goal was necessary. I recomended
              creating an Experience Roadmap (Exr), which aims to help teams
              stay focused, create stability & drive a consistent user
              experience.

          <p>Defining user stages, from pre-sale to post-sale</p>
          <p>
            The first thing we took up was organizing our roadmap at a high
            level, as user stages and calling them Experiences. From start to
            finish, we mapped five distinct stages our users would pass through.

          <p>Identifying touchpoints</p>
          <p>
            We now started defining our users' interactions by describing
            touchpoints our users would use to interact with our organization.
          </p>
          <img
            src={
              process.env.PUBLIC_URL +

        <div>
          <p>Synthesizing insights</p>
          <p>
            We identified key user and business insights by focusing on
            answering three main questions -
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What users are thinking at that time? </li>
            <li>What users are feeling at that time? </li>
            <li>Are there any points of friction the users face? </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Next plan of action was to conduct research by communicating
            directly with the users. For this we laid down key points we wanted
            to determine:
          </p>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>What did they like about the product? </li>
              <li>What didn‚Äôt you like about the product?</li>
              <li>
                What are their feelings towards the current process in place?
                Does it meet their expectations?
              </li>
              <li>
                What touchpoints and steps does the user take in each phase to
                achieve their goal? How do they find and interact with these
                necessary touchpoints?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is there any friction as they pass through different customer
                phases?
              </li>
              <li>How easy is the transition between each phase?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However, due to time constraints, we were not able to gather
              sufficient data and decided to do it after the next release of the
              product. This would help us investigate problems that may arise
              later.

          <p>
            Using the Jobs to be Done framework, as a team we chalked up a few
            user stories. This showed multiple points in the experience which
            were misaligned to what the user needs. We boiled them all down to
            three main areas:

            <p>Brainstorming for ideas</p>
            <p>
              We conducted a brainstorming session to explore a vast number of
              ideas and approaches to solve the target problems. We later
              organized and filtered our ideas by creating two categories,
              Improvements and New. This helped us understand the nature of the
              idea and an overview plan of implementation.
