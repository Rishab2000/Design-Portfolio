                    Next plan of action was to conduct research by communicating directly
                    with the users. For this we laid down key points we wanted to

                        it meet their expectations?

                    <li>
                        What touchpoints and steps does the user take in each phase to
                        achieve their goal? How do they find and interact with these
                        necessary touchpoints?

                    <li>
                        Is there any friction as they pass through different customer
