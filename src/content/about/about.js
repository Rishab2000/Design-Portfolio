                Hi again, I'm Rishab,
                <br />
                <br />
                A UX designer based in Bangalore working towards making
                someone's life a little bit easier.

                I deeply think about the stories of the people who will interact
                with products, I'm working on and the context of their experiences.
                I aim to create products with the utmost consideration towards
                minimizing negative emotions and create
                delightful - frictionless - experiences.

                To me, design is more than just work. It enables me to explore, experiment and
                equip me with novel ways of tackling challenges in the real world
                <br />
                {/* Most of my work has been in the UI/UX field, but have been focused
              on moving to Product Design for designing end-to-end experiences,
              and creating fluent digital products that engage, satisfy and
              educate.  */}
                {/* Empathy in all stages of the design process will drive the
              formation of an ideal future while increasing the spectrum by
              looking at the bigger picture of how design, technology, and
              ubiquitous computing can make a larger impact on our everyday
              lives. One of the milestones in my design career is to provide the
              vision of making humans a space fairing species and to propel
              accessibility for space exploration to new heights. User
              Experience is a critical backbone for creating products for Zero-G
              environments, spacecraft controls, and navigation systems. I was
              born in Hungary, you'll notice the funky accent! Immigrated to the
              U.S. when I was 11 years old without speaking any English. Grew up
              in the rainy suburbs of Seattle, and moved up to downtown for UW.
              A decade later I became a United States Citizen! */}
                <br />
                Apart from design, I've learnt some amount of programming,
                mostly focusing on web frontend development and also some aspects
                of backend systems. My knowledge about technical possibilities
                and limitations helps lead to strong designer-developer
                relationships.

              <br />
              He is good at documenting journeys and communicating design
              decisions, and has a very good attitude. Overall he is a team
              player and showed a learning spirit to always keep improving the
              work."

              seamlessly into our development team.
              <br />
              <br />
              He's naturally curious about products, asks great questions and
              tries to understand different perspectives of a problem before
              offering a range of solutions along with his reasoning. His
              pragmatic approach coupled with his knack of improving his
              technical and functional skill set has been a driving factor in
              our product lifecycle.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a design student, he naturally possesses an abundance of
              creativity, but it's his willingness to work hard and his
              dedication that really catches the eye. He shows great maturity in
              his role and as his mentor, I'm looking forward to seeing him
              continue his professional development."
