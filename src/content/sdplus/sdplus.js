          business and technical goals. The overall user experience of the
          redesigned product was proved easy to use by multiple users in
          hands-on demos conducted after the interim release.

          <p className="font-avenir-book text-base">
            Next plan of action was to conduct research by communicating
            directly with the users. For this we laid down key points we wanted
            to determine:
          </p>
          <div>

                What are their feelings towards the current process in place?
                Does it meet their expectations?
              </li>
              <li>
                What touchpoints and steps does the user take in each phase to
                achieve their goal? How do they find and interact with these
                necessary touchpoints?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is there any friction as they pass through different customer
                phases?
              </li>
              <li>How easy is the transition between each phase?</li>

            <p className="font-avenir-book text-base mb-8">
              However, due to time constraints, we were not able to gather
              sufficient data and decided to do it after the next release of the
              product. This would help us investigate problems that may arise
              later.

            Agile software development process. Following the agile methodology
            helped me in three main aspects: space for change & iteration, focus
            on the user through user stories & improve overall quality by
            breaking down tasks into manageable chunks.
